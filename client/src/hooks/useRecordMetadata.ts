 * One record's history, from the one endpoint that answers for it: when it was
 * created, when it last changed, and who did each.
 *
 * The one place the client asks. A page can show a record's creation date in
 * its own words, and the badge in the corner opens the full history; both are
 * the same fact and must be read the same way, or a page ends up displaying a
 * date the badge disagrees with. That is exactly what happened while pages
 * read their own bespoke `created_at` column, and this hook is what keeps the
 * two answers to one.
 *
 * A record with nothing recorded answers `null`, which is an ordinary answer
 * and not an error: every record that predates this bookkeeping reads that way
 * until something touches it.
 *
 * Nothing invalidates this query, so it is never treated as settled: a
 * record's history is written by whatever mutation caused it, moments after
 * that mutation answered, and by other people's mutations besides. The
 * client's default is to cache a query forever, which here would pin a
 * record's history to whatever was true when the page first opened. A record
 * created seconds ago is the sharpest case: its first read can beat the
 * after-commit write and see nothing at all.
