# ============================================================================
# Sirius — production Docker image
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Multi-stage build:
#   1. builder  — installs all deps (incl. the toolchain for native modules
#                 like bcrypt), builds the Vite client and the esbuild server
#                 bundle, then prunes dev dependencies.
#   2. runtime  — a lean image with only production node_modules + dist/.
#
# IMPORTANT: this build intentionally does NOT run `npm run build` directly,
# because that script begins with `npm run db:push`, which contacts a live
# database and is forbidden in production. Instead we run the Vite + esbuild
# steps on their own. Database schema is applied automatically by the
# migration runner when the server starts (it also refuses to boot if the DB
# is out of sync), so no database is needed at build time.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# BUILD
#   docker build \
#     --build-arg VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_xxx \
#     -t sirius:latest .
#
#   VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY is baked into the client bundle at build time
#   (it is a publishable, non-secret Clerk key). Omit it if Clerk is not used.
#
# RUN
#   docker run -p 5000:5000 \
#     -e DATABASE_URL="postgres://..." \
#     -e SESSION_SECRET="..." \
#     -e SERVICE_ROLE="static,api-ws" \
#     sirius:latest
#
# REQUIRED runtime environment variables (provide via `-e` / your deploy):
#   - DATABASE_URL          PostgreSQL / Neon connection string (required)
#   - PORT                  Port to listen on (optional, default 5000)
#   - SESSION_SECRET        Express session signing secret
#   - SERVICE_ROLE          Optional comma-separated runtime selector:
#                           static (SPA/assets), api-user (application API),
#                           api-ws (/api/ws). Unset runs all three roles.
#                           This chooses behavior in this one image; it does
#                           NOT require separate images, ports, or commands.
#   OPTIONAL, depending on which features/components are enabled:
#   - Clerk:        CLERK_SECRET_KEY (+ VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY at build)
#   - Stripe:       STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
#   - Object store: AWS_*/GCS credentials as configured
#   - SAML/Okta/OAuth and any SITESPECIFIC_* values used by your deployment
#   Provide whatever your enabled feature set requires — these are read from
#   the environment at runtime and are NOT baked into the image.
#
# RESTART POLICY (required for the in-app Restart button)
#   The admin page at /admin/restart lets an operator restart the app. A
#   process can only ever end itself: "Restart" shuts down cleanly and exits
#   with code 75. Something OUTSIDE the container must start the replacement.
#
#     docker run --restart unless-stopped ...   # recommended
#     docker run --restart always ...           # also fine
#     docker run --restart on-failure ...       # fine — exit 75 is non-zero
#     docker run ...                            # NO restart policy: pressing
#                                               # Restart takes the site down
#                                               # and it STAYS down until
#                                               # someone starts it again.
#
#   Under an ECS service or a Kubernetes deployment the replacement is started
#   for you and no flag is needed. A container's restart policy cannot be read
#   from inside the container, so when the app cannot establish that it is
#   supervised, the page says so and demands a typed confirmation.
#
# CAVEAT: features that rely on `puppeteer-core` (e.g. some PDF generation)
# need a Chromium binary in the container. This image does not install one.
# If you use those features, install Chromium and set PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH
# (or switch to full `puppeteer`) in a derived image.
