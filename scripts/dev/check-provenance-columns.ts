/**
 * Check Bespoke Provenance Columns
 *
 * "When was this record made, and by whom?" has one answer in this codebase:
 * `entity_metadata`, written by the storage logging middleware, read by the
 * record-history badge and the admin metadata viewer. It covers every logged
 * table at once, names a person as well as a date, and keeps a modified stamp
 * the table's own columns never did.
 *
 * Roughly two dozen tables predate it and carry their own `created_at`,
 * `updated_at`, `created_by` or `date_created` column — a second, partial
 * answer to the same question, usually date-only, never with a person, and
 * never kept in step with the framework the rest of the app reads. Retiring
 * them is a task per area; `docs/provenance-columns.md` is the inventory and
 * the decision rule those tasks follow.
 *
 * This rule stops the pile growing while that work lands. A new
 * creation/modification date or person column in the shared schema is a
 * violation unless it is on the allowlist below — which starts as the
 * inventory's KEEP list (operational timestamps that are business data, not
 * provenance) plus every column not yet retired. Each area task deletes its
 * own entries as it lands, so the list drains to just the keepers.
 *
 * WHAT IT SEES. Column declarations in `shared/` schema files: the database
 * column name inside a Drizzle column builder, attributed to the `pgTable`
 * whose block it sits in. It is textual — it reads the schema as written, not
 * as pushed — which is the point: the schema file is where a new column gets
 * added, and where the reviewer is looking.
 *
 * ADDING A COLUMN AND MEANING IT. If the column really is operational data —
 * a rate-limit window, a cache's freshness, when a message was sent, when an
 * event fired, a history row's effective date — add it to ALLOWLIST with the
 * reason, and add it to the KEEP table in `docs/provenance-columns.md` so the
 * two say the same thing. If it is provenance, do not add it: the framework
 * already answers it, for free, for every table.
 *
 * Usage: npx tsx scripts/dev/check-provenance-columns.ts
