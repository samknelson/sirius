/**
 * Move what `users.created_at` / `users.updated_at` and `roles.created_at`
 * know into provenance, before the next migration drops them.
 *
 * The columns are the only record of when these accounts and roles came into
 * being, and dropping them without this would replace every account's real
 * creation date with the date of the migration. Provenance can say more than
 * they ever could — it names a person — but only for what it watched happen;
 * for everything that predates the framework the old column's date IS the
 * history, and it has to be carried over intact.
 *
 * The shared seeding routine does the carrying (see
 * `server/storage/system/entity-metadata-seed.ts`): it wraps its own
 * transaction, only ever makes a stamp more truthful, and reports rather than
 * fails when a column is already gone — which is what makes this safe to
 * re-run on a database where 1095 has already dropped them.
 *
 * Neither table has ever recorded WHO, so no person is seeded here. Accounts
 * created from now on get their creator from the storage logging middleware.
