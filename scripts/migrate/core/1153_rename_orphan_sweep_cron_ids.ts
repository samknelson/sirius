 * Rename the two polymorphic-child orphan sweeps to match the tables they
 * actually sweep (`entity_notes`, `entity_files`).
 *
 * A cron plugin's id is not just code: it is the `plugin_configs.plugin_id` of
 * the singleton row carrying the operator's schedule and enabled flag, and the
 * `cron_job_runs.job_name` of every past run. Renaming the plugin without
 * moving those leaves the operator's row an orphan the scheduler warns about
 * on every boot ("no plugin registered"), while the renamed job seeds a fresh
 * row on the default schedule and starts its run history over.
 *
 * The stored `name` is left alone: it is operator-editable, so a site that has
 * retitled the job keeps its title. The registered display name is what the
 * admin list falls back to.
 *
 * Idempotent, and tolerant of a site that has neither row yet (a fresh
 * database seeds them under the new ids on first boot). If a site somehow
 * holds BOTH spellings as cron configs, this refuses rather than guessing
 * which one carries the live schedule — merging them would silently discard an
 * operator's settings.
