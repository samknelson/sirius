/**
 * Move what `dispatch_jobs.created_at` and `dispatches.created_at` know into
 * `entity_metadata`, before migration 1093 drops them.
 *
 * Both tables are already under storage logging, so every job and dispatch
 * saved since the provenance framework landed already has a stamp. These are
 * the ones that predate it: their only record of when they were made is the
 * bespoke column, and dropping it without seeding first would simply lose
 * that history.
 *
 * Neither table records WHO created a record, so the seeded rows carry a date
 * and an unknown person — which is the truth about them. New records get a
 * person from the logging middleware.
 *
 * Idempotent and never-downgrading: see `seedFromColumns`. Both tables belong
 * to the (optional) `dispatch` component, so on a deployment where dispatch
 * is off the seed states a skip instead of failing the boot.
 *
 * Imports the seed storage's own factory rather than the `server/storage`
 * barrel: this file is on the boot path, and the barrel drags the whole
 * storage graph in behind it.
