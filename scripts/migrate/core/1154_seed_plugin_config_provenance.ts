/**
 * Move what `plugin_configs.created_at` / `updated_at` know into provenance,
 * before the next migration drops them.
 *
 * The table is the unified home of component, cron, notifier, charge and
 * dashboard settings, and until now its two timestamp columns were the only
 * record of a configuration changing — a date with no person and no diff. The
 * storage layer logs the table now, so every change from here on is a record
 * history entry; this is the history that already happened, carried across so
 * "created" on an existing configuration keeps meaning the day it was made
 * rather than the day this ran.
 *
 * Idempotent: the shared seeding routine only ever makes a stamp more
 * truthful, and reports zero rows written on a second run. Once the columns
 * are gone it states that and writes nothing, so a re-run after the drop is a
 * stated no-op rather than a failure.
