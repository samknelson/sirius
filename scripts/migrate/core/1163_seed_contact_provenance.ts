/**
 * Move what `contact_phone` and `contact_postal` know about their own history
 * into `entity_metadata`, before the next migration drops the columns.
 *
 * `contact_phone.created_at` and `contact_postal.created_at` / `updated_at`
 * predate the provenance framework. Both tables are already logged, so every
 * mutation from here on files provenance by itself; what these columns hold is
 * the history of every row written BEFORE that, and it only survives if it is
 * copied across first.
 *
 * Neither table records WHO, so every seeded row keeps an unknown person —
 * the framework's honest answer for a record it met mid-life. Only the dates
 * are recoverable, and those are moved by the shared routine
 * (`storage.entityMetadataSeed.seedFromColumns`), which never moves a stamp
 * backwards, never replaces a known person with nobody, wraps its own
 * transaction, and reports zero rows written on a rerun.
 *
 * One of these dates is not decorative: the SMS reads pick a worker's number
 * by "active primary, oldest first", which used to mean
 * `contact_phone.created_at` and now means the provenance created date seeded
 * here. That is why this runs before the drop rather than alongside it — the
 * pick has to keep giving the same answer across the pair.
