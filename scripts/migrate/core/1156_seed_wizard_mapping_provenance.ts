/**
 * Move what the two wizard mapping tables' own timestamp columns know into
 * `entity_metadata`, before migration 1080 drops them.
 *
 * `wizard_feed_mappings` and `wizard_employment_status_mappings` are
 * operator-editable configuration — which column of an imported file feeds
 * which field, and which of an employer's employment statuses means which of
 * ours — and both predate the provenance framework, carrying their own
 * `created_at` / `updated_at` and naming nobody. They joined the storage
 * logging framework in the same change, so from here on a mapping's history
 * is written for it; this seeds what already happened.
 *
 * Neither table records WHO, so every seeded row keeps an unknown person and
 * only its dates: that is what the columns hold, and the routine does not
 * guess.
 *
 * `wizard_report_data` is deliberately not here. Its rows are bulk output of a
 * report run, not records anyone edits, and its `created_at` stays as the
 * operational column the retention purge reads — see
 * `docs/provenance-columns.md` and the note on `wizardLoggingConfig`.
 *
 * Idempotent: the shared routine only ever makes a stamp more truthful, so a
 * second run writes nothing.
