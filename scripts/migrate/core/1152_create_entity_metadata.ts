/**
 * One provenance row per record, for every table whose storage module emits
 * audit logs. Written in-application by the storage logging middleware — no
 * trigger, best effort by contract.
 *
 * `entity_id` is unique on its own (all ids are UUIDs) and `seq` is a second,
 * permanent sequential name for the record. `table_name` names the table the
 * record lives in and is never rewritten, so a seq keeps meaning one row in
 * one table for as long as the record exists.
 *
 * The `*_by` columns reference users and null out when a user is deleted:
 * losing the account must not lose the timestamp.
 *
 * There is no soft reference back from the owning table and no FK to it —
 * `entity_id` is polymorphic, the same convention `entity_notes` and
 * `entity_files` use. Rows are removed by the middleware when it observes a
 * logged delete.
 *
 * Idempotent.
