/**
 * Drop `dispatch_jobs.created_at` and `dispatches.created_at`.
 *
 * `entity_metadata` is now the single answer to "when was this made, and by
 * whom" for both tables: migration 1092 seeded it from these columns, the
 * storage logging middleware maintains it on every save, and the job details
 * page reads it. Keeping the columns would keep a second, person-less answer
 * that only the rows written before the framework ever agreed with.
 *
 * Nothing else read them — no dispatch API response, event payload, or
 * eligibility/bullpen/listing path — except the job list's newest-first
 * ordering, which now sorts on the provenance date instead.
 *
 * Guarded per column rather than assumed: both tables belong to the optional
 * `dispatch` component and do not exist at all on a deployment where it is
 * off, and a core migration that dies on a missing table stops that
 * deployment's boot. The check also makes the migration re-runnable.
