/**
 * Move what `edls_sheets.created_by` knows into provenance, before the column
 * is dropped (per-component migration `edls:006`).
 *
 * `created_by` holds the user who made the sheet — the framework's question,
 * answered a second time by a column. `entity_metadata` is where that answer
 * lives now, so the person has to reach it before the column goes or the
 * attribution is simply lost.
 *
 * THE DATE. The sheet table has no creation date at all: `changed` is its
 * last-save watermark, refreshed on every save. That is the earliest date this
 * table can honestly claim for a sheet's creation — an upper bound, the same
 * kind of claim the framework's own backfill makes when it meets a record
 * mid-life — and the seeding routine will not invent one, so it is what gets
 * named. Nothing is lost by naming it: the routine only ever makes a stamp
 * more truthful, so a sheet whose real creation the framework already observed
 * keeps that earlier date and its recorded creator.
 *
 * Idempotent, and safe where the `edls` component is off: the routine states
 * that the table (or the column) is not there and writes nothing rather than
 * failing the boot of a deployment that does not run EDLS.
