/**
 * Move `employer_policy_history.created_at` into provenance, ahead of 1097
 * dropping it.
 *
 * The table carries two dates: `date`, the effective date of the policy
 * change (business data, staying), and `created_at`, when the entry was
 * recorded — a second, partial answer to the question `entity_metadata`
 * answers for every logged table (see `docs/provenance-columns.md`). The
 * entry order the history page shows is decided by that recorded-at date, so
 * it has to reach provenance before the column goes or the ordering loses the
 * only thing it sorted on.
 *
 * `created_at` is NOT NULL here, so every existing entry has a date to seed
 * from and none is passed over. It knows only WHEN, never who — which the
 * seeding routine preserves rather than guessing at, so seeded entries keep
 * an unknown creator and only entries recorded from here on name a person.
 *
 * Idempotent, and it wraps its own transaction: both are the shared routine's
 * doing (`server/storage/system/entity-metadata-seed.ts`), as is the stated
 * skip if the column is already gone.
