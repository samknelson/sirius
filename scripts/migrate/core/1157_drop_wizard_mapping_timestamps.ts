/**
 * Drop the bespoke provenance columns from the two wizard mapping tables.
 *
 * Migration 1079 moved what they know into `entity_metadata`, and both tables
 * are now wired into the storage logging framework, so a mapping's creation
 * and last change — with the person, which these columns never had — are the
 * framework's answer from here on.
 *
 * The only read either column had was the "most recently changed first"
 * ordering of a user's saved feed mappings, which now reads
 * `entity_metadata.modified_date`.
 *
 * `wizard_report_data.created_at` is untouched on purpose: it is operational,
 * not provenance (see `docs/provenance-columns.md`).
 *
 * Idempotent: every drop is IF EXISTS.
