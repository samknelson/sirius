/**
 * Carry `bookmarks.created_at` into provenance before the column is dropped.
 *
 * A bookmark's creation date is not decoration: the bookmarks page and the
 * dashboard widget both order by it and show it. The table is now under
 * storage logging, so from here on `entity_metadata` records who added a
 * bookmark and when — but only for bookmarks added from here on. Every
 * bookmark that already exists knows its own date and nothing else does, so
 * it has to move before the next migration drops the column, or the whole
 * list loses its order.
 *
 * Only the date moves: the column never recorded who added the bookmark, and
 * the seeding routine does not guess. The bookmark's owner is NOT that person
 * — `user_id` says whose list it is on, not who put it there — and while
 * those are the same person today, writing it as the creator would be
 * inventing provenance from a foreign key.
 *
 * Idempotent, and safe to run after the admin backfill has already stamped
 * these records: the routine only ever makes a stamp more truthful. See
 * `docs/provenance-columns.md`.
