 * Retire `plugin_configs.created_at` / `updated_at`.

 * They answered "this configuration changed" and nothing more — not what
 * changed and not who changed it — which is the wrong question for the table
 * that now holds component, cron, notifier, charge and dashboard settings.
 * `entity_metadata` (seeded from these very columns by migration 1079) plus
 * the audit log answer both.
 *
 * Runs after the seed, and `IF EXISTS` keeps a re-run — or a deployment
 * baselined past this point — a no-op.
