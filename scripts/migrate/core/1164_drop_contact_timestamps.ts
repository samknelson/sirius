/**
 * Drop the bespoke timestamps from `contact_phone` and `contact_postal`.
 *
 * Everything these columns knew is in `entity_metadata` by now — migration
 * 1088 put it there, and the storage logging middleware has been keeping both
 * tables' provenance up to date all along. What is left is a second, partial
 * answer to "when was this made, and when did it last change": date-only,
 * person-less, and no longer read by anything. The reads that used to order by
 * them (the SMS number pick, the worker list's phone and address columns, the
 * replacement-primary choice) now ask provenance the same question.
 *
 * Idempotent: every drop is IF EXISTS, so this is safe on a database that has
 * already been brought in line by a schema push.
