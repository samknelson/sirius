/**
 * The event vocabulary.
 *
 * NAMING CONVENTION (the standard for every event added from now on)
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------
 * An event name is `<entity>.<action>` with the transaction PHASE appended as
 * the last segment:
 *
 *   - `<entity>.<action>.before` — emitted BEFORE the transaction opens.
 *   - `<entity>.<action>`        — emitted INSIDE the transaction, so a
 *                                  handler's writes commit or roll back with
 *                                  the write that announced them.
 *   - `<entity>.<action>.after`  — emitted AFTER the transaction commits (via
 *                                  `onAfterCommit`), so nothing is announced
 *                                  for a write that rolled back. Best effort:
 *                                  a failing handler cannot undo the write.
 *
 * Only the phases actually needed are declared and emitted — there is no
 * requirement that a storage layer emit all three for an action.
 *
 * Events are PER ENTITY: `worker.delete.after`, never a generic
 * `entity.delete.after` carrying a type discriminator. Nothing else in this
 * system dispatches on a payload field, and a per-entity event lets a handler
 * subscribe to exactly the record types it can act on.
 *
 * LEGACY: the `<entity>.saved` names below predate this convention. They are
 * the target of a future rename to `<entity>.save[.before|.after]` — deliberately
 * NOT done yet, because each name is subscribed to by name. Do not invent a
 * third spelling: new events use the convention above.
