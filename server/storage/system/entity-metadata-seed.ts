/**
 * Moving a table's OWN creation/modification columns into `entity_metadata`,
 * once, from a migration.
 *
 * Roughly two dozen tables predate the provenance framework and carry their
 * own `created_at` / `updated_at` / `created_by` / `date_created` column — a
 * second, partial answer to "when was this made, and by whom". Retiring one
 * is a task per area (`docs/provenance-columns.md` lists them), and every one
 * of those tasks has the same first step: whatever the old column knows has to
 * reach provenance before anything is dropped, or the history it holds is
 * simply lost.
 *
 * This is that step, written once. A migration names the table and which of
 * its columns hold the four facts, and gets back either what was seeded or a
 * stated reason nothing was.
 *
 * ## What it promises
 *
 *  - **It only ever makes a stamp MORE truthful.** An earlier created date
 *    wins, a later modified date wins, a known person replaces an unknown one.
 *    Nothing here moves a stamp backwards and nothing replaces a real person
 *    with nobody — the same monotonic rules `./entity-metadata.ts` applies to
 *    every other write, spelled the same way in SQL so that concurrent writers
 *    settle identically. That is what makes it safe to run AFTER the admin
 *    backfill has already stamped a record at backfill time: the seed's older,
 *    truer creation date simply replaces the backfill's "first sighting".
 *  - **Running it twice changes nothing the second time.** The conflict path
 *    updates a row only when one of those four improvements actually applies,
 *    so a second run reports zero rows written rather than rewriting every row
 *    with the values it already holds.
 *  - **It wraps its own transaction.** The migration runner does NOT wrap
 *    `up()` (see `docs/architecture-decisions.md`), so the seed opens one and
 *    a partial failure rolls back whole.
 *  - **A table that is not there is skipped, not fatal.** A component-owned
 *    table does not exist while its component is off, and a core migration
 *    that dies on it bricks the boot of every deployment where that component
 *    is disabled. Same for a column the schema no longer has: the seed states
 *    what it could not find and writes nothing.
 *
 * ## What it does not do
 *
 * It does not guess. A record whose bespoke columns hold only a date keeps an
 * unknown person — only the date is recoverable — and a record that offers no
 * date at all is passed over entirely and counted, because a provenance row
 * has to carry a date and the seed has none to give. A table that knows WHO
 * but not WHEN therefore has to name the earliest date it can honestly claim
 * (its last-saved watermark is one; a fabricated "now" is not).
 *
 * ## Why raw SQL
 *
 * Same reason the upserts in `./entity-metadata.ts` are: the timestamps are
 * naive columns holding wall clock in the process zone, and the whole point
 * here is to move a value from one such column to another WITHOUT it passing
 * through a JavaScript `Date` and picking up a zone conversion on the way.
 * Every value stays inside the database for the whole trip.
 */

/**
 * Which of one table's columns hold the four provenance facts.
